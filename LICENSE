A shasta2 executable includes, in binary form, code compiled from source
in the following GitHub repositories. 
This file includes the required license notices 
for these repositories, following the licensing notices for the shasta2
repository itself:

* aappleby/smhasher
* seqan/seqan.
* rvaser/spoa

Shasta2 can also call various separate executables during its execution.
This includes Graphviz and poasta, plus several standard Linux commands. 
These executables are not redistributed by the shasta2 repository, not even in binary form,
and therefore their licensing notices are not included here.
